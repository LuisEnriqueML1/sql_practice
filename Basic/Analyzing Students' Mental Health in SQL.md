# 📊 Introduction 

In 2018, a Japanese university with a diverse student body conducted a comprehensive survey. The following year, an ethically and regulatory approved study based on this research was published.

The study found that international students face a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. Furthermore, the research identified that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with adapting to a new culture) are significant predictors of depression. 🧠💔

# Description 📝

To better understand this problem and find common trends, I used  SQL for exploring and analyzing data  📊.  To make the analysis even more insightful, I also used RStudio. . But it doesn't stop there! I wanted to go a step further and find groups of students who may be more prone to mental health challenges. So, I employed a clever algorithm called K-means clustering using Python. It's like having a robot assistant that can categorize students based on their unique characteristics.🤖 


## Dataset
The dataset includes the following variables:

* inter_dom: Indicates the type of student, distinguishing between international and domestic students. 🌍🏠
* japanese_cate: Measures Japanese language proficiency among the students. 🇯🇵🎓
* english_cate: Measures English language proficiency among the students. 🇬🇧🎓
* gender: Indicates the gender of the student. 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓
* academic: Represents the current academic level of the student. 📚
* age: Represents the current age of the student. 🎂
* stay: Represents the current length of stay in years. 🕒
* todep: Total score measuring depression levels. 😞
* tosc: Total score measuring social connectedness. 🤝
* toas: Total score measuring acculturative stress. 🌍🤯

According to National Institutes of Health:
**For todep:**

* Scores less than 5 almost always signify the absence of a depressive disorder.
* Scores of 5 to 9 predominantly represent patients with either no depression or subthreshold (other) depression.
* Scores of 10 to 14 represent a spectrum of patients.
* Scores of 15 or greater usually indicate major depression.
